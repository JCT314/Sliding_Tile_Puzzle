A web application based on the tile sliding puzzle game. Use WASD, click, tap(if touch screen is enabled) to move the tiles into empty spaces until they are ordered from smallest to greatest. You can change the grid size between 3 by 3, 5 by 5, or 7 by 7. The fastest time for each grid time will be stored until the user reloads the page or restarts the application. Store the files in one folder and click on index.html to begin.
